A web application (front-end) with authentication that shows the places closest to the user in map and list format. This application is a Angular SPA that consults two APIS: Google Maps to find the closest places based on user geolocation (https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) and REQRES (https://reqres.in/) that's a FAKE API to simulate authentication). This appication was hosted at Heroku, and you can access through this link: https://elaine-bempertin.herokuapp.com/#/homepage
